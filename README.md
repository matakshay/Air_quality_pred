# Air_quality_pred

Implemented Locally Weighted Regression (LOWESS) algorithm to predict the quality of Air Pollution. Each training/testing example has 5 features on the basis of which, the quality is predicted

It uses the Closed Form Solution for this algorithm, with bandwidth parameter set to 0.1

An accuracy of 96% (Coeff. of Determinaton converted to percentage, rounded to nearest integer) has been achieved on the testing dataset.
